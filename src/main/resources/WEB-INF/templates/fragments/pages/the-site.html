    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p class="paragraph">
        This site is a portfolio project that also is my portfolio.
        The subsequent sections walk you through every framework I had to learn and (some of the many) obstacles I had to surpass.
        Feel free to look through the code! The repository for it is here:

    <h2>Shaders!</h2>
    <p class="paragraph">
        The flashiest part of this website I spent the most time on.
        The background is my own custom Navier-Stokes running on your GPU.
        Using the features of WebGL 2.0, every simulation step uses many render passes and many
        render buffers to get its final state. The simulation is spread across the input, diffusion, projection,
        and advection steps for both the density and velocity fields.
        Visual rendering to the canvas is decoupled from simulation to allow for frame blending;
        I toiled over many optimizations to get it to run in realtime and still be energy/mass conserving.
        Here's a link to specifically the shader/controller code:
        <a href="https://github.com/everttr/the-site/tree/main/src/main/resources/static/js/fluid" target="_blank">(I'm very much proud of it)</a>

    <h2>AWS/SpringBoot Server</h2>
    <p class="paragraph">
        AWS/SpringBoot Server
        You're currently on the dynamically served version of this site hosted on an AWS EC2 server
        <a href="https://github.com/everttr/the-site-static" target="_blank">(the static version on GitHub Pages can be found here)</a>.
        It's build with SpringBoot, and uses GitHub actions for continuous deployment to the remote server (built with a bunch of
        my own custom scripts),
        and it also has a few dynamically served bells and whistles for good measure. Additionally, everything that can be generalized
        about the page's layout is rendered by the server with Thymeleaf.
